# HR_DESHBOARD
The motive of developing an HR dashboard in Power BI is to provide a comprehensive and interactive view of the human resources (HR) data in an organization. The HR dashboard can be used by HR managers, executives, and other stakeholders to make informed decisions based on real-time HR data.
